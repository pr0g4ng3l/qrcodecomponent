### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a better understanding of the top property and the relative position.
I learned how to work with variables in CSS.

```css
:root {
      --white-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      --light-gray-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      --grayish-blue-color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
      --dark-blue-color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning and reinforcing the position property and how to center a div vertically.

### Useful resources

- [Variables in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me working with variables.
